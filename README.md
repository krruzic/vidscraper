# USAGE
start the program with `npm i && npm run start`, it will prompt you for a TV show name. 
Enter one, it will then look it up on IMDB and use the first search result (!!)


# INFO
- Saves files to `/home/USER/Videos/SHOW_NAME`, pretty easy to change the code to adjust this. 
- Skips files that already exist, this won't check that the file was actually completely downloaded however!
- No error handling, if a download link can't be found idk what will happen
